 => To log your hours, it is important to track all tasks as they are completed using the FreshBooks timer. You should log that time under your client's FreshBooks project in real-time. It's crucial to ensure you are using a client's contracted hours before their billing cycle ends and to avoid working beyond those hours without permission. Additionally, report your time spent to your client at least once per week. For further concerns, you should contact your Relationship Specialist [Source: PeachtreeVA Onboarding Packet (2025 May)].

Would you like help wording an email for reporting purposes, or do you have other questions about time tracking?
