It's crucial to ensure you are using a client's contracted hours before their billing cycle ends and to avoid working beyond those hours without permission. Additionally, report your time spent to your client at least once per week. For further concerns, you should contact your Relationship Specialist [Source: PeachtreeVA Onboarding Packet (2025 May)].
